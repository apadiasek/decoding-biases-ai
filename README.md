Investigating whether Spotify’s algorithms are biased is challenging, given that independent researchers do not have access to the system’s black box. The relationship between gender identity indicated while registering an account and the recommendation system is perplexing. Werner (2020) suggested that while gender is not a direct input, it may indirectly influence the recommendations users receive. Taking that into account, we devised an innovative research design through which we sought to understand how the indicated identity might influence Spotify’s recommendations.

#### 1. Account creation
<p align="justify"> 
The investigation commenced by creating four new Spotify accounts with distinct gender identities: John Doe (man), Jamie Doe (prefer not to say), Jo Doe (non-binary), and Jane Doe (woman). All accounts utilized gender-neutral email addresses (e.g. zctqlgk@proton.me) to ensure gender wasn't revealed through the email address.

#### 2. Listening experiment
<p align= "justify">
We coordinated the listening behaviour of all four accounts, as Spotify’s algorithms use timing in their recommendations.
  
* Firstly, we listened to music from the ‘New Music Friday’ playlist for two weeks at the same intervals. This playlist is one of the most important avenues for emerging artists to promote their music (Aguiar and Waldfogel, 2020). Every week, 50 new songs are added to each country’s playlist. During the first week of our experiment, we listened to roughly half of the ranking, and the next week, we heard through the entire playlist.

* Once Spotify created some recommendations through the ‘Discover Weekly’ playlist, we analyzed them to see if there were any discrepancies. The vast majority of songs (26 out of 30) overlapped. We found only a few disparities. We created playlists at each respective account with a generic name, ‘My Playlist #1’, featuring 26 songs that overlapped across all four accounts. As with the ‘New Music Friday’ playlist, we listened to the playlist at the same intervals.

* After completing the previous steps, we coordinated listening to some podcasts. Purposefully, we chose episodes targeting female recipients to see if that may alter the recommendation system (the complete list of the podcasts can be found in the Annex)

#### 3. Data collection and comparative analysis
<p align="justify"> 
Throughout the experiment, we captured screenshots of each account’s display to compare and identify potential discrepancies regarding the recommendations. At the conclusion of the experiment, we utilized Exportify, a tool that facilitates the export of playlists into spreadsheet format. We collected data on various recommendations, including Daily Mixes and “Discover Weekly” playlists. Then, we analyzed whether significant differences exist in terms of artists’ gender and profile (established vs. emerging) by coding each artist’s gender and status (we define an artist with over a million monthly listeners as an established one). Once we collected all the data, we prepared some exploratory data visualizations and descriptive statistics to describe our findings.
