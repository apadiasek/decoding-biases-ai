#### 4.1. Results on the gender bias in Spotify music recommendations.

<p align="justify"> 
On examining the Discover Weekly Playlists recommended for the four accounts after two weeks of listening to the New Music Friday playlist, the vast majority of songs (26 of 30 songs) in the playsts overlapped. It is thus impossible to state whether the differences observed had any significance and were influenced by the gender assigned to each of the accounts. Due to the design of the experiment, such that only one account per each gender category was created, no intra-gender comparison could be made, to state if such differences are not random. Therefore, we have decided to discontinue the analysis of music recommendations. No differences in Spotify music recommendations were furthermore noted, on listening to the specifically curated playlist (“My Playlist #1”). Future research could build upon this design barrier, using multiple accounts of the same gender to confirm our initial hypothesis.

#### 4.2. Results on the gender bias in Spotify podcasts recommendations.

“Feeding” the Spotify podcasts recommendations’ algorithm took time for all four accounts, with at least three listening sessions needed to receive recommendations related to the content of the podcasts we had listened to. This lag can likely be explained by the previously mentioned “cold-start problem” because the recommendation system lacked a robust music listening history (and had no podcast listening history whatsoever) to begin building its recommendations on. Spotify did not have significant data off of which to base personalized recommendations. (Potential responses to this problem by recommender systems include onboarding (presenting options to a user and asking them to rank their preferences; scraping online information about a user; and updating suggested content based on user ratings) (Nazari et al.).  The category monitored (“Recommended Podcasts”) always contained nine podcasts recommendations for all accounts tested, with the recommendations changing daily (see Figure X for an example). Each time, apart from the data gathered on 23rd April 2024 which reflect the initial podcast recommendations, the recommendations data were gathered after a listening session, to account for a possible stagnation of recommendations of the account due to lack of consistent listening activity. That is because the accounts were only used for podcast listening sessions of up to 3 hours long.

##### 4.2.1. Changes in numbers of stereotypically female podcasts recommended for the accounts over time.

<p align= "justify">
Our findings suggest that there exists a disparity in the speed of Spotify podcasts recommendation of stereotypically female podcasts, depending on the gender of the user. As such, gender stereotypes may thus influence whether a user receives personalised recommendations if the interests of the user go against the stereotypical subjects associated with a given gender. In comparison to accounts associated with “woman”, “non-binary” and “prefer not to say” categories, the “man” account took longer to adjust its recommendations to podcasts classified as stereotypically female (see Figure X). While “woman”, “non-binary” and the “prefer not to say” accounts received between 33-44% of the recommendations as female-coded podcasts after just three listening sessions, the “John Doe” account did so only after four listening activities (2nd May 2024). The account classified as “woman” was the first one to reach almost universally female-coded recommendations, with eight female-coded podcasts recommended out of nine possible recommendations. However, on additional listening sessions, the number of female-coded recommendations for this account dropped, reaching only 6 out of 9 on the last day of the study. 

Conversely, even though the account classified as “man” did not begin to receive recommendations as early as the other accounts, after six listening sessions it was the one to receive the most female-coded recommendations - 8 out of 9 possible recommendations were female-coded for this user, on 9th May 2024 as well as on the last day of the study (12th May 2024). The “non-binary” and “prefer not to say” accounts also experienced upward trends in terms of the number of stereotypically-female podcasts recommended to them over time. The “non-binary” account was the least affected account out of four categories tested, receiving a maximum of 66% recommendations coded as stereotypically female. Similarly, the “prefer not to say” account, although steadily rising in the number of female-coded recommendations, received no more than 7 out of 9 recommendations coded as stereotypically female.
